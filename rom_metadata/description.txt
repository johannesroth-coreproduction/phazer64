One forbidden button. One blown-up satellite.
Zero time before Mom gets home!

Phazer 64 is a retro-flavored 2D space adventure blending UFO action, RPG exploration, and platforming - on Nintendo 64.

When a kid presses the forbidden button, Terra's main satellite gets blown-up by a powerful laser.
UH-OH! (Yes, it was you.)
Good thing you've got a homemade UFO in the garage. You have to repair the damage - before your parents come home and find out.
LET'S GO!

Embark on an adventure through space. Meet new alien friends and explore strange planets - both above and underground.

* Fly through open space and race tracks
* Land on planets, switch from flight to on-foot
* Explore surface and underground areas
* Collect Star Nuggets to fund upgrades
* Unlock weapon systems to blast asteroids
* Use your space map to find the satellite pieces
* Rebuild the satellite with a tractor beam

Will you convince Crankhorn, the galaxy's best mechanic, to install his new tractor beam?
Can you piece the satellite back together - or are you about to get grounded for life?
